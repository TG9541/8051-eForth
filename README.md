# 8051-eForth

This repository contains a 30 year old variant of Dr. C.H. Ting's eForth for the 8051: John C. Wren ported the code from MASM to the [AVCASE51](https://github.com/jcwren/avcase51) tool chain, and implemented, e.g., basic arithmetic words in 8051 assemble for a much improved performance.

The first commit contains the code provided to me by JC Wren (29/May/2022). It was filtered with `dos2unix` and is otherwise the original baseline. 

Development targets are:
* porting to the SDCC toolchain (with sdas8051)
* containerized tool chain with test and build in GitHub Actions
* modularization in a similar way as [STM8 eForth](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef)
* target recent MCS-51 based ÂµCs like the Nuvoton N76E003 without external bus
